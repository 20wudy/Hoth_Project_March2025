# LitterAlly

LitterAlly (pronounced "literally") is an interactive mobile app that tells you where a piece of trash belongs. Simply open up the app, activate our scanning function, and take a picture of the trash, and our sequential classification model will determine whether it belongs in landfill, recycling, compost, or hazardous waste. Protect the environment, earn fun achievements, and get roasted based on your behavior, all in one!

Built with React Native for frontend, Python for backend. 

Need to add the AI separately for the backend, ran locally, from https://github.com/20wudy/LitterAlly_AI.git
